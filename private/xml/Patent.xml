    <Advantages>In addition, the solder which is melted being transmitted, not only the tapered sec
tion of the underside, along the tapered section of the side of lead/read and the side surface of lead/read it gets wet and has become easy to spread, furthermore, it gets wet to also the tapered section of the surface of lead/read and because it becomes easy to spread, surface to the whole 4 of the point of lead/read the solder is connected. 
Depending, as for inclined angle I it is desirable to make below the 7.5.deg., it is more desirable to make below the 6.0.deg., furthermore it is desirable to make below the 5.0.deg.. In addition, when error and the dispersion in regard to production of form of the metallic plate connector are considered, as for inclined angle I it is desirable to make above the 2.5.deg., it is more desirable to make above the 3.0.deg.. 
Depending, synthesizing these points, when it considers, as for inclined angle I it is desirable to make below the 7.5.deg. above the 0.5.deg., it is more desirable to make below the 6.deg. above the 2.deg., furthermore it is desirable to make below the 5.0.deg. above the 3.0.deg.. 
As a result, because reliability of the electric connection where the void rate of occurrence in the solder which lies between with the aforementioned composition plane and the aforementioned suffering composition plane is high, is by the solder decreases and resistance becomes high, there was a possibility problem such as overheating and igniting occurring the occasion where for example the high electric current of 100A flowed.

    <Abstract>A uniaxial actuator wherein a ball return path, which returns balls (4) of a ball screw mechanism from the terminal point to the starting point of a raceway, is configured from a through-hole (24), which penetrates a slider (2) in the lengthwise direction of a threaded shaft (3), and an end deflector (6). The end deflector (6) has a direction-switching path connected to the through-hole (24). The main body (61) of the end deflector (6) is fitted into notch parts (26) formed at both ends of the slider main body (2A) in the lengthwise direction of the threaded shaft (3). Thus, the size of the cross-sectional shape perpendicular to the lengthwise direction of the threaded shaft of the slider can be reduced when the diameter of the outer circumference of the threaded shaft is identical to that of a uniaxial actuator which uses a circulation tube to form the ball return path, and the load capacity can be increased when the dimensions in the lengthwise direction of the threaded shaft of the slider are identical.</Abstract>
